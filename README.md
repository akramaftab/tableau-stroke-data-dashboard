# Stroke Data Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)

## Short Description / Purpose

The Stroke Data Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Tableau project designed to provide an in-depth analysis of stroke incidence and risk factors within a patient population. It offers healthcare professionals, data analysts, and policymakers actionable insights into patient demographics, health conditions, and lifestyle factors influencing stroke outcomes. The dashboard facilitates identification of high-risk groups and supports data-driven strategies for stroke prevention and management.

## Project Objective

This dashboard aims to deliver a detailed overview of stroke-related health data, enabling users to explore stroke rates across different gender, age groups, smoking status, work types, and residence types. By illuminating patterns in hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and smoking habits related to stroke occurrences, the project supports targeted interventions and improved healthcare resource allocation.

## [Dataset Used](https://github.com/akramaftab/tableau-stroke-data-dashboard/blob/main/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv)

The dataset contains comprehensive healthcare records of 5,110 patients, capturing rich information including:
- Stroke occurrence flags indicating whether a patient has suffered a stroke.
- Patient demographics: gender, age, work type, residence type, and marital status.
- Health indicators: hypertension cases, heart disease presence, average glucose levels, and BMI values.
- Lifestyle factors: smoking status categorized into never smoked, formerly smoked, and currently smoking.
The data covers a diverse population with varied risk factors, supporting multi-faceted analysis.

## Key Questions (KPIs)

- What is the overall stroke rate among the patient population? (4.87%)
- How does stroke incidence vary by gender, age group, and work type?
- What percentages of patients suffer from hypertension and heart disease, and how do these relate to stroke rates?
- How does smoking status distribution correlate with stroke occurrences?
- What is the average BMI among patients, and does it impact stroke risk?
- Which patient segments (age, gender, work type) demonstrate higher stroke rates, and how can they be addressed?
- How do heart disease and hypertension rates vary across age groups relative to stroke rate?

## Process

- Data preparation: Cleaned and pre-processed patient records for consistency and accuracy.
- Data analysis: Used Tableau to create dynamic KPIs, bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs illustrating stroke rates and associated risk factors.
- Visualization design: Developed interactive dashboard filters for gender, age, smoking status, hypertension, residence type, work type, and BMI to enable granular data exploration.
- Validation: Cross-checked visualizations and statistics with data summaries to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Dashboard Interaction

Users can filter and explore data dynamically by various demographics and clinical factors. Visuals update in real-time, allowing selective investigation of stroke trends, risk distributions, and patient group comparisons. This capability supports focused healthcare analysis and decision-making.

## Summary KPIs

- Total Patients: 5,110
- Stroke Rate: 4.87%
- Percentage of Male Patients: 41% 
- Percentage of Smokers: 15.4%
- Hypertension Cases: 498
- Average BMI: 28.9
- Percentage with Hypertension: 9.7%
- Percentage with Heart Disease: 5.4%

## Key Insights

- Stroke incidence increases markedly with age, especially beyond age 50, with 17.75% of patients over 70 experiencing stroke.
- Females show a higher stroke rate (59%) compared to males in the dataset.
- Smoking remains a significant risk factor, with nearly 15.4% smokers in the patient population.
- Hypertension and heart disease cases have a strong correlation with stroke rates, especially in older age groups.
- Work type impacts stroke prevalence, with self-employed and government job holders showing higher rates.
- BMI averages near 29 indicate overweight status, a known contributing factor to stroke risk.

## Business Impact & Healthcare Value

- The dashboard provides clinicians and public health officials with clear, actionable insights into stroke risk factors and population segments requiring focused care.
- It supports data-driven public health campaigns targeting smoking cessation, hypertension control, and lifestyle interventions.
- Enables hospital administrators to allocate resources effectively to high-risk demographics.
- Assists policymakers in designing screening and prevention programs tailored to vulnerable populations identified through data.

## Final Conclusion

The Stroke Data Analytics Dashboard offers a powerful tool for understanding and reducing stroke risk through comprehensive visualization of epidemiological data. By integrating demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables, it equips healthcare stakeholders to make informed decisions, prioritize interventions, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

## Tech Stack

- Tableau Desktop for interactive visual analytics
- Data cleaning and preprocessing via spreadsheet tools and Python (optional)
- CSV data storage and management
- Advanced Tableau features: KPIs, filters, pie charts, bar graphs, line charts, and dynamic drill-downs
